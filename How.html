  We've got some baby trees on the way:
  <br />
  <br />
  Manuka
  <br />
  Ti kouka
  <br />
  Kowhai
  <br />
  Harakeke
  <br />
  <br />
  And the Wellington City Council have offered us their shovels and gloves to do the planting with.
  <br />
  <br />
  The biggest and most potent 'how' of this equation is our hands: yours, mine, everyoneâ€™s.
  What we do with them is what will be gained from them.

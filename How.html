  We've got some baby trees on the way:
<br />
  Manuka
  <br />
  Ti kouka
  <br />
  Kowhai
  <br />
  Harakeke
<br />
  And the Wellington City Council have offered us their shovels and gloves to do the planting with.
<br />
<br />
The biggest and most potent 'how' of this equation is our hands, yours, mine, everyones. What we do with them is what we will get from them.

  we've got baby trees on the way:
  <br />
  <br />
  manuka
  <br />
  ti kouka
  <br />
  kōwhai
  <br />
  harakeke
  <br />
  <br />
  and the wellington city council have offered us their shovels and gloves to do the planting with.
  <br />
  <br />
  the biggest and most potent 'how' of this equation is our hands: yours, mine, everyone’s.
  what we do with them is what will be gained from them.

  since we first began watching the news we've been warned of climate change. since we first began being warned of climate change, nothing has gotten better—in fact, it’s getting worse.
  <br />
it can be hard to know what to do, except wait around to die.
in response to this feeling of hopelessness we are organising a day where everyone can come together and give some love to papatūānuku. we are not prolific gardeners or environmental activists, just three young persons committed to paying attention to the world around us, and contributing to its ongoing transformation. this project emerges from our trust in love and in care, in our conviction that altering our everyday behaviours will change not just what we think, but the conditions for thought.
<br />
<br />
we know that in the anthropocene, humans have the power to inscribe ourselves onto landscapes, sometimes irreversibly. the consequences of misusing this power can be devastating — they have been. but this power can be restorative, too. we don't think that planting a few more native trees is going to stop the earth from heating or remove the plastic from our moana. but we’re not doing this to save the earth. we are doing it to be with the earth. to recognise that we are always with the earth, and that paying attention to this relationship can make a powerful impact on the way we think about our city, and on the city itself.
<br />
<br />

despite the onset of the anthropocene, we still see papatūānuku as an agent of her own change, ultimately more powerful than any of us. while we are kaitiaki of her awa and moana and ngahere, she is also a kaitiaki to us. we are floored every day by the beauty surrounding us, and we are ready to give some back.

Since we first began watching the news we've been warned of Climate Change.
Since we first began being warned of climate change, it hasn't stopped and as far as we can see the
warnings are more than reasonable.
<br />
We're not waiting around to die, we are organising a day where everyone can come together and give some love to Papatūānuku.
We are not prolific gardeners or environmental activist just a few girls who are committed to contributing to the earth.
We are joined by our trust in love and the power of what we can do when we change the conditions for our thoughts.
<br />
<br />
We don't think that planting a few more trees is going to stop the earth from heating up or vanish the plastic filling our seas.
But we're not doing it to save the world, we're doing it to be with the world. <br />
We see the earth as an agent of her own change, a being more powerful than any of us, and while we are guardians of her, she
is also guardian to us. We are floored every day by the beauty and calm that the world gives us and we are ready to give some back.
<br />
Our names are Mina, Frankie and Maeve.

If this sounds like a bit of you too then let's talk...

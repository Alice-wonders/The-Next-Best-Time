Sitting with Eco-anxiety: Rest as Resistance
<br />

<br />
Eco-anxiety (n): ^A chronic fear of environmental doom.^
<br />
<br />
In a time of constant debate over what constitutes a meaningful response to the climate crisis, eco-anxiety has become more common than ever as chronic fear escalates into complete overwhelm. Not only do we face the terror of ‘environmental doom’, we find ourselves paralysed and petrified by a host of potential avenues for action, none of which feel even vaguely sufficient. Ecological collapse looms large; eco-anxiety is an entirely reasonable response.
Unfortunately, it’s more than a mere spot of worry. Eco-anxiety can be debilitating. It makes us feel powerless, and it’s routinely deployed to keep the powerful secure in practices of exploitation, over-extraction, and oppression. While the idea that we have influence as consumers might occasionally feel empowering, it also promotes the idea that we should simply consume a little less destructively, rather than change our attitudes towards consumption in general. It keeps us shackled in a system of being valued according to our ability to perform competently as buyers and sellers in the marketplace, as algorithms for productivity and growth. The inequity here should be obvious: access to sustainably produced clothing and organic produce is unevenly distributed. We can’t all afford to buy eco-friendly detergents and shop exclusively at organic refilleries. And our other lifestyle choices are compromised, too: not everyone can swap car travel for walking or cycling to class. Is effective climate response, then, only for the wealthy, the able-bodied, the mentally well?

<br />
<br />
And if we accept that those who tell us the power to save our planet lies in our wallets are profiting from an insidious form of misdirection, then what avenues for action remain open to us? Taking political action is absolutely essential—please do it in any and every way you can—but it does not always manage to ward off the distressing feeling that each immense effort we make is simply not enough, and never will be. Even after days and months spent reading, debating, and marching, the sheer impenetrability of a political establishment bent on appeasement over action can be demoralising. This is no reason to give up. But in order to effectively engage in these spaces, we need better ways to deal with the overwhelm of eco-anxiety.
Anxiety traps us in the claustrophobic space inside our skulls. It’s this isolation that makes each of these tiny waves of terror feel positively tidal—relentless and all-consuming. There’s no avoiding the kicker: life for a small human in the Anthropocene is fraught. It should be. If you’re not worried, there’s a problem. But we can’t always be firing on all cylinders. This pursuit of productivity and progress can even enmesh us more deeply into the logic of endless growth which is driving this escalating climate crisis. We too easily forget that caring for ourselves and caring for the landscapes we dwell in are not mutually exclusive acts. In a world where our attention, time, and emotional labour are constantly being bartered for by corporations and questionable political interests, nurturing our mental health can be an intentional act of resistance. Choosing where to place our attention—and insisting on noticing what we are constantly being distracted from	is one of the most fundamental avenues for response which is open to us. This avenue can make that claustrophobic place inside our heads feel remarkably roomy.
A lot of this is pretty abstract, a testament to the way discussions about the climate crisis too often dislocate us from the terms and stakes of the struggle itself. The forces at work feel vast and unmanageable. Now, adrift in this stream of paralysing frequencies, I find it difficult to conjure up a sense of what we’re seeking to recover. It might be helpful to zoom out a little—or, perhaps, to zoom in.
Watching a single tree transform through autumn, winter, summer; noticing the first kōwhai blossom of the spring on your way to class; or the way millions of mushrooms seem to emerge overnight sometime around the beginning of autumn, unfolding along the intersection of native and nonnative forest—all of these are legitimate and meaningful acts of resistance. To simply watch a tūī fluttering from branch to branch, to recognise that the birdsong outside your window this morning is a little different to yesterday, is to observe the intricacies of life unfolding, not in an abstract way, but in the actual spaces where we dwell.  What does it ^feel like to experience a particular place? To spend time with a favourite tree, or animal, to be in your favourite park? I’m talking here not just about places reserved for nonhuman life, but especially about urban spaces—pockets of life on the town fringes, green spaces between city blocks.
Being present in these spaces offers an opportunity to explore the part we play in these ecosystems, and resist the urge to separate humanity from Nature in some precise act of intellectual dissection. For many of us it can be hard to reconcile an amorphous or abstract concept of capital-n Nature with our local parks and back gardens. But life doesn’t just ^happen. It is not “out there”, far from the reality of concreted suburban blocks or inner city high-rises; life is made up of individual interactions in particular spaces, in particular moments of time, and it’s everywhere.
<br />
<br />
I’d suggest that one of the most meaningful responses we can have towards the terrifying reality of present and future climatic breakdown is to turn these contaminated spaces from places of inattention to places of connection, fostering a mutual care between human and nonhuman life in our direct community. Tending to a garden without particularly knowing what you hope to get out of it—perhaps food or an attractive patch of sunflowers, but perhaps just a greater sense of how humans can contribute to the ongoing formation of a certain piece of earth—can be radical. The term ^radical, after all, comes from the Latin ^radix, which means ‘root’.
What would it mean for us to relocate our attention away from the anxiety-inducing, overwhelming, fact-dumping world of sustainability chatter? Could it remind us of exactly what’s at stake when we talk about zero-waste living and carbon-neutral policies? And might that constitute something radical as an alternative to my default mode of response to eco-anxiety—the dreaded Twitter doomscroll? This kind of noticing might revolutionise not just ^what we think, but ^how we think—the very conditions for thought. It works to carve out a space for caring for the environment that doesn’t distract from, but reacquaints us with, the real, necessary, potent sites for debate around climate action.
Not all meaningful, earnest, or effective climate action has to come at the expense of our emotional wellbeing. There are as many ways to care for the world, as there are to care for yourself; there are as many ways to look at a tree as there are moments in a day. Sustainability spaces can be jargony, exclusive, inaccessible, reductive. Everyone’s experiences and capacity to deal with this crisis are different, and so we shouldn’t expect a standardised response. It’s good to take a break. It’s good to take a breath. Stepping back from the emotional turmoil can be its own form of rebellion. The first, most basic, and most accessible antidote to eco-anxiety might just be stopping, looking around, and taking off your shoes.
Anthropocene living is overrated, but there’s value to be uncovered in this soil. These contaminated spaces we find ourselves in provide fertile ground for an infinite number of possible expressions of life that have yet to germinate. There is space for everyone to make new ways (or uncover old ones) to live well on this planet. If you’re reading this and you feel like whatever you do is not enough, I hope these words can give you a sense that every action that moves towards life, towards nurturing, compassion, connection, and generosity, is enough.

<br />
This is a project for people to communicate with the earth in a meaningful and tangible way.
<br />
Its about creating a space where people and plants are given equal claim to space.
Because, whether you want to admit it or not,our relationship with trees is give and take.
When you smell a flower you also breathe onto her.
<br />
We are organsing a day for you to plant your own native tree or bush. In planting it you will be contributing to the earth.
Your caring will become an active verb, an act of love, release and resistance. The tree you plant will have it's own feelings
about you, and your relationship will be something for you to cherish and return to. Planting it you will also accept that it's
not yours, never was or will be, but that through the act of planting you have become a guardian to it. What else you may
garner from this experience is yours to find. But no matter where you go in your life where you plant this tree will always be
somewhere you can return to, to sit beside.

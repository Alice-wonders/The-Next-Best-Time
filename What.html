  This is a project for people to communicate with the earth in a meaningful and tangible way.
  It’s about creating a space where people and plants are given equal claim to space.
  Because our relationship with other beings is give and take. When you smell a flower, you breathe onto her.
  <br />
  We are organising a native planting day. In joining this project, you will be contributing to the ongoing transformation of the earth.
  Your involvement will make ‘care’ into an active verb, an act of love, release, resistance—and surrender.
  We see this as dialogue, not monologue. We see these trees, bushes, this land, as subject, not object.
  The trees you plant will have their own unique relationship with you, a relationship to treasure and remember and carry its memory with you.
  In planting, you might also accept that this tree is not yours—it never was or will be—but through the act of planting you have become a guardian to it and it to you.

  <br />
  <br />
  Whatever else you might garner from this experience is yours to find.
  But no matter where you go in your life, this tree will always be someone to return to, to sit beside, to talk to, or to listen to.

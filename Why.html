only you can answer this question for yourself. but if you want to hear some of our thoughts, here are a few answers:
  <br />
  <br />
  ☞  because studies suggest having your hands in soil for ten minutes a day releases happy hormones in your head.
  <br />
  <br />

  ☞ because <em>'beside every blade of grass is an angel saying, "grow, grow, grow"'</em> - (kabbalistic saying)
  <br />
  <br />

  ☞ because there are as many ways to look at a tree as there are moments in a day.

  <br />
  <br />

  ☞ because loving the world is an act of self love.

  <br />
  <br />

  ☞ because powerful humans and our modern economic systems have turned ‘growth’ from something organic to something artificial, insupportable, unlimited and impossible.
  because we believe it’s important to do what we can to nurture the growth that is life-giving, not life-destroying.

  <br />
  <br />

  ☞ because we may all be going to hell in a handbasket, but there’s nothing valuable to be gained from simply waiting around to die,
  wallowing in distraction and self-regard. Let’s at least have a good time while we're here, in a way that won’t cost the earth more than she can give.
  what better way to enjoy ourselves than putting our hands in the soil and feeling the earth sing?

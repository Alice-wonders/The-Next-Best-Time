  If you have to ask yourself that question then we really can't help you.

  But if you want more than one answer then here are a few!
  <br />

  Because studies have shown that having your hands in soil for ten minutes a day releases happy hormones in your head.

  <br />

  Because <em>'Beside every blade of grass is an angel saying, "grow, grow, grow"'</em> - (Kabbalistic saying)
<br />

  Because there are as many ways to look at a tree as there are moments in a day.

  <br />

  Because loving the world is as good as loving yourself

  <br />

  Because we may all be going to hell in a hen basket but lets at least have a good time while we're here, and what better way to enjoy ourselves than putting our hands in the earth and feeling the earth sing?
